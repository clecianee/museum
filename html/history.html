  <h2>Origins</h2>
  <p>The Museum of Stones and Colors traces its roots back to the late 19th century, when a group of naturalists and artists in Europe began collecting rare minerals not only for their scientific value but also for their aesthetic beauty. Among them was Amélie Duarte, a Portuguese-Brazilian geologist and painter, who believed that stones carried both the memory of the Earth and the poetry of color. Her personal collection of gemstones, pigments, and mineral-inspired artworks became the foundation of what would one day be the museum.</p>
  <h2>Early Development</h2>
  <p>The first official gallery opened in 1903, in a modest space adjoining a botanical conservatory. Unlike traditional mineral collections, which focused on classification and hardness, this museum highlighted the visual experience of stones — their hues, textures, and natural artistry. Visitors often described the exhibits as feeling like stepping into “the Earth's own palette.”
  During the early 20th century, the museum expanded its holdings through donations from explorers, archaeologists, and indigenous communities who contributed artifacts demonstrating how minerals had been used in tools, trade, and rituals.</p>
  <h2>The Modern Era</h2>
  <p>By the 1960s, the museum was recognized internationally as a bridge between science and art. Its exhibitions began to combine geological specimens with contemporary artworks inspired by natural minerals, establishing a unique interdisciplinary focus.
  In the 1990s, a new wing dedicated to anthropology and archaeology was added, showcasing how humans across cultures had incorporated stones into jewelry, weapons, religious objects, and daily life. These displays emphasized the symbolic meanings of color in different civilizations — from the sacred use of lapis lazuli in Mesopotamia to the protective jade amulets of Mesoamerica.</p>
  <h2>Today</h2>
  <p>The Museum of Stones and Colors is celebrated worldwide as the only institution dedicated exclusively to the interplay of geology, culture, and color symbolism. Its galleries include:<br>
  Hall of Earth's Palette - mineral displays organized by color spectrum.<br>
  Human & Stone - archaeological and anthropological artifacts.<br>
  Art in Stone - modern and contemporary works inspired by mineral forms.<br>
  Museum Shop - featuring gemstone-inspired objects, prints, textiles, and educational items.<br>
  With ongoing research programs and collaborations with universities, the museum continues to honor Amélie Duarte's vision: that stones are not just matter, but memory, color, and meaning intertwined.</p>
