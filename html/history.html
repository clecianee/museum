  <h2>About the Museum of Stones and Colors</h2><br>
  <p>The Museum of Stones and Colors traces its roots back to the late 19th century, when a group of naturalists and artists in Europe began collecting rare minerals not only for their scientific value but also for their aesthetic beauty. Among them was Amélie Duarte, a Portuguese-Brazilian geologist and painter, who believed that stones carried both the memory of the Earth and the poetry of color. Her personal collection of gemstones, pigments, and mineral-inspired artworks became the foundation of what would one day be the museum.</p><br>
  <h2>Early Development</h2><br>
  <p>The first official gallery opened in 1903, in a modest space adjoining a botanical conservatory. Unlike traditional mineral collections, which focused on classification and hardness, this museum highlighted the visual experience of stones — their hues, textures, and natural artistry. Visitors often described the exhibits as feeling like stepping into “the Earth's own palette.”<br>
  During the early 20th century, the museum expanded its holdings through donations from explorers, archaeologists, and indigenous communities who contributed artifacts demonstrating how minerals had been used in tools, trade, and rituals.</p><br>
  <h2>The Modern Era</h2><br>
  <p>By the 1960s, the museum was recognized internationally as a bridge between science and art. Its exhibitions began to combine geological specimens with contemporary artworks inspired by natural minerals, establishing a unique interdisciplinary focus.
  In the 1990s, a new wing dedicated to anthropology and archaeology was added, showcasing how humans across cultures had incorporated stones into jewelry, weapons, religious objects, and daily life. These displays emphasized the symbolic meanings of color in different civilizations — from the sacred use of lapis lazuli in Mesopotamia to the protective jade amulets of Mesoamerica.</p><br>
  <h2>Today</h2><br>
  <p>The Museum of Stones and Colors is celebrated worldwide as the only institution dedicated exclusively to the interplay of geology, culture, and color symbolism. Its galleries include:<br>
  Hall of Earth's Palette - mineral displays organized by color spectrum.<br>
  Human & Stone - archaeological and anthropological artifacts.<br>
  Art in Stone - modern and contemporary works inspired by mineral forms.<br>
  Museum Shop - featuring gemstone-inspired objects, prints, textiles, and educational items.<br>
  With ongoing research programs and collaborations with universities, the museum continues to honor Amélie Duarte's vision: that stones are not just matter, but memory, color, and meaning intertwined.</p>

      <h2>Canaanite Ivory Comb (ca. 1700 BCE)</h2><br>
      <h3>Facts</h3><br>
      <p>This small ivory comb, measuring roughly 3.5 by 2.5 centimeters, was crafted from elephant ivory and dates back to around 1700 BCE. It was discovered at Tel Lachish, Israel, an important Canaanite city. The comb is dual-sided, with one row of coarse teeth for detangling and another with fine teeth for removing lice. Microscopic remains of lice were detected on the comb, confirming its everyday use. Most significantly, it bears one of the earliest examples of alphabetic writing, inscribed in early Canaanite script. The inscription reads: “May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard.”</p><br>
      <h3>Interpretation</h3><br>
      <p>The comb represents both the daily life of ancient peoples and their intellectual advances. While its primary use was grooming and hygiene, the inscription suggests a ritualistic or protective quality — the words act almost like a charm. It also shows how even ordinary objects could carry symbolic meaning. The use of ivory, a luxury material imported from afar, indicates the owner was likely of high status or wealth.</p><br>
      <h3>Comparative Notes</h3><br>
      <p>This comb can be compared to other grooming tools from antiquity, such as Egyptian ivory combs of similar age, though the alphabetic inscription makes it unique. Egyptian combs, often found in tombs, tend to be purely functional or decorative, while this Canaanite example intertwines utility with early written expression. It also predates many alphabetic inscriptions from the Levant, giving it special importance in the study of language development.</p><br>
      <h3>Cautionary Note on Interpretation</h3><br>
      <p>While the inscription provides direct evidence of literacy, scholars must be cautious not to over-interpret its cultural significance. It is unclear whether the comb's owner personally understood the writing or whether it was added by a specialist. Similarly, while the comb indicates elite ownership due to its ivory material, it does not necessarily mean all such tools were exclusive to the wealthy. Archaeologists stress the need to place this artifact in its broader context before drawing sweeping conclusions about literacy and status in Canaanite society.</p><br>
