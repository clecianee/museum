        <h2>Jacob Smith - Field Researcher & Collections Specialist</h2>
        <br>
        <h4>Late 20s | Anthropology & Archaeology Enthusiast</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Jacob Smith is one of the vibrant young minds behind the Museum of Stones and Colors. Growing up with a fascination for the natural world, Jacob spent much of his youth hiking forest trails, climbing rocky outcrops, and collecting unusual stones he found along the way. This early curiosity led him to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Anthropology with a focus on Archaeology, where he specialized in lithic analysis—the study of stone tools and artifacts.
        <br><br>
        At the museum, Jacob’s role blends both fieldwork and curation. He participates in excavation projects, carefully documenting and retrieving artifacts, and later works in the museum’s lab to analyze, classify, and preserve them. He’s especially skilled in identifying stone types, determining their origins, and explaining how ancient peoples shaped and used them.
        <br><br>
        When Jacob isn’t working in the collections room or leading educational tours, you’ll likely find him outdoors—camping, hiking, or exploring geological sites for inspiration and research. His passion for both the science and the artistry of stones brings a unique perspective to the Museum of Stones and Colors, where every object tells a story and every story connects us to the people who came before.</p>
