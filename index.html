            <h2>Welcome to the Museum of Stones and Colors!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Museum of Stones and Colors, where the natural artistry of the Earth comes to life. Here, each stone tells a storyâ€”not just through its shape and texture, but through the vibrant hues that have formed over millions of years. From the deep indigos of lapis lazuli to the fiery reds of jasper, our collection celebrates the rich interplay between mineral composition and color. This unique intersection of geology and beauty invites you to explore how nature paints with elements, creating timeless pieces that have inspired cultures, artists, and healers across centuries. Step inside and discover a world where every color holds meaning, and every stone holds history.
